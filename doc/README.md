Welcome to Documentation
========================

This is a Markdown-based documentation example

Yes, you can just write your documentation in Markdown
using all its features.

And [Docute](https://github.com/egoist/docute) can just render it for you on-the-fly to HTML.  
This is optional, of course.

Good luck!
